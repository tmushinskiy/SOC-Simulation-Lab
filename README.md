# SOC Simulation Lab

## Objective

The SOC Simulation Lab project is designed to create a realistic Security Operations Center environment using open-source tools. The main goal is to simulate cyber attacks, collect and analyze security logs, and develop the ability to detect, investigate, and respond to threats within a controlled setting. This project helps build foundational SOC skills including alert tuning, incident triage, and network monitoring.

### Skills Learned

- Hands-on experience setting up and managing SOC environments.  
- Proficiency in ingesting and analyzing logs from multiple sources.  
- Understanding of cyber attack simulation and detection techniques.  
- Ability to tune alerts and reduce false positives.  
- Incident triage and basic investigation workflows.  

### Tools Used

- Wazuh (SIEM for log ingestion and alerting)  
- Security Onion (full SOC platform with IDS/NSM tools)  
- Wireshark (network traffic capture and analysis)  
- Suricata and Zeek (network intrusion detection and monitoring)  
- Sysmon and Windows Event Viewer (endpoint logging)  
- VirtualBox (virtual lab environment)
